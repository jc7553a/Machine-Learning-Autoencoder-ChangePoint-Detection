# Summer Research on Machine Learning 

Creating anomaly detection algorithms for Autoencoders with Professor Nathalie Japkowicz at American University

The data sets are from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository and I am using Wisconsin Breast Cancer

Right now I am calculating a threshhold determination for the autoencoder at 2 Standard Deviations away from the mean of the Average Loss 
The loss is calculated when running Testing Data on Benign Cancer, also known as holdout error.
