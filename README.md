Machine Learning Summer Research with Dr. Nathalie Japkowicz

Used Change Point detection methods in changePoints.py and applied them to the reconstruction errors of One Class Learning algorithms

Autoencoder.py holds the Autoencoder Class

TrainingProgram.py is a file to train an autoencoder and print the classifcations and reconstruction errors to a file

TestingProgram.py Runs a variable sized sliding window based upon change points found.

flairs4.pdf is the paper submitted to FLAIRS31 conference which explains in depth the algorithms used in the files given.
